== This is the RHQ-version of mc4j-EMS.

This is a fork of the EMS code base from mc4j that changes
some behavior in a way that better matches RHQ.

If you are looking for the original code you can either
look at the base revision or go to  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mc4j/

== Building

You can build the bits via `ant jars` and then
deploy the artifacts to a local maven repo via `ant install`.

You can deploy to a remote repository using
`ant maven-deploy -Durl=https://.../ -DrepositoryId=...`

== maven version

This fork uses the original packages from mc4j, but adds a `-rhq` designator
to the jars like this:

[source,xml]

<dependency>
     <groupId>mc4j</groupId>
     <artifactId>org-mc4j-ems</artifactId>
     <version>1.3.6-rhq</version>
